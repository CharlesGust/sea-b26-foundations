About Me
---------

I'm originally from Seattle and last year, after graduate school I returned to Seattle to work on projects for eSage Group, a systems integration and analytics consultancy. Before graduate school I worked as a product manager for Scientific Explorer and Elmer's Products, developing children's educational activity kits. I learned Python through Code Fellows and am excited to pick up JavaScript.
