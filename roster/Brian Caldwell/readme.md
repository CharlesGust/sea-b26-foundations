####About Me

My friends suggested that I take the Intro to C Programming course at UCF with my last credits. I enjoyed it so much I don't even know why I resisted at first. I moved onto CS1 after that. I then taught English at a kindergarten in Seoul, South Korea for two years while continuing to take programming classes online, like C++ and HTML. I want to make the jump into the professional realm. I am from Cocoa Beach, FL which is unfortunate because I love hiking up mountains.
