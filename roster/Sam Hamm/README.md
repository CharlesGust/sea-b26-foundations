I recently moved to Seattle after spending 8 years as a music professor at [Rocky Mountain College](http://rocky.edu) in Billings, MT. I grew up in central Alabama, and I lived in Florida for almost all of 1991-2005. My wife Kimberly is an attorney and is a Seattle native who works for the King County District Court.

Here I am with my wife and our dogs (L-R, Parker and Demi):

I'm taking this bootcamp to update and refine my tech skills, to figure out my next step forward, and to continue chasing the quest of what I want to be when I grow up.
