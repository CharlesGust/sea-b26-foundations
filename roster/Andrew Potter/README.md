Hey, my name is Andrew Michael Potter. I'm from Bend, OR, and just moved to Seattle on August 1st. I'm very new to programming, and still learning how to work Git correctly.

I don't have a Twitter or a LinkedIn, but you can feel free to reach me on Facebook: [here] (https://www.facebook.com/AndrewIsRad)

Here's the only good photo of me:
